## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Using Node.js Server (Recommended for Video)

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/lasaj917/Claude Code/dreamer-ai-website/frontend/public
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser to: `http://localhost:3000`

### Option 2: Direct File Access (Without Video)

Simply open the file in your browser:
```bash
open /Users/lasaj917/Claude Code/dreamer-ai-website/frontend/public/index_fixed.html
```

Note: The video won't work with direct file access due to browser security restrictions.
