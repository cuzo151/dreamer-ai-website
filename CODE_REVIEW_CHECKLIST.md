## Quick Reference

### Common Issues to Look For
1. **Memory Leaks**: Unsubscribed events, unclosed connections
2. **Race Conditions**: Async operations without proper handling
3. **SQL Injection**: Direct string concatenation in queries
4. **XSS Vulnerabilities**: Unescaped user input in HTML
5. **Performance Issues**: N+1 queries, unnecessary loops
6. **Type Safety**: Use of `any`, missing null checks
7. **Error Handling**: Unhandled promise rejections
8. **Code Smells**: Long functions, deep nesting, duplicate code

### Questions to Ask
- What problem does this code solve?
- Is this the simplest solution?
- Will other developers understand this?
- How will this perform at scale?
- What could go wrong?
- Is this testable?
- Is this secure?

Remember: The goal of code review is to improve code quality and share knowledge, not to criticize. Be constructive, specific, and kind in your feedback.
